# Fibonacci-Algorithms

# Objective
The code provides three different implementations of the Fibonacci sequence - fibonacci_direct, fibonacci_recursive, and fibonacci_memo. The fibonacci_direct function directly calculates the n-th Fibonacci number using a for loop, while fibonacci_recursive uses recursion to calculate the Fibonacci number. fibonacci_memo is similar to fibonacci_recursive but uses memoization to optimize the function and eliminate redundant calculations.

The run_batch_tests() function executes each Fibonacci implementation with varying inputs and records the time taken to execute. The results are stored in a Pandas DataFrame and then plotted using Matplotlib to visualize the time taken to execute each algorithm for different input sizes. The main function executes run_batch_tests() if the script is run as the main program.
